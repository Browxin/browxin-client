## What's Browxin?
First thing first, please check Browxin.

Browxin is a Platform of Web App.
You can use it as a start page, new tab, etc...
It can be used by pc, tablet, smart phone, even sidebar of browser.

As I said, it's a platform, so you can make your own App and commit.
All Apps should be free in Browxin.

You can run Browxin in your local machine.
I only provide client side but it's enough to make new App.
